# Text Encryption and Decryption Project

This project is a simple web application for encrypting and decrypting text using a predefined set of rules. The user interface displays a text input area where the user can enter the text they want to encrypt or decrypt. Additionally, it provides visualization of the process.
 
 ## Features
This project consists of the following functionalities:

- Text Encryption: The encrypt() function takes the text entered by the user and encrypts it according to a predefined set of rules.
- Text Decryption: The decrypt() function allows decrypting the encrypted text using the same set of rules.
- Display Elements: The showElement() and showText() functions control the visibility of elements in the user interface.
- Copying Text to Clipboard: The copyText() function copies the text in the display area to the user's clipboard.


 ##Use 
To use this application, simply follow these steps:

1. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt into the text input area.
2. Click the encryption or decryption button depending on what you want to do with the text.
3. The result will be displayed in the visualization area. If necessary, you can copy the text to the clipboard by clicking the corresponding button.

 ##Considerations 
- Make sure to enter valid text before encrypting or decrypting.
- The encryption and decryption rules are predefined and cannot be directly modified from the user interface.
